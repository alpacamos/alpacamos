## Hello, ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zeynep. I am pursuing my bachelor's / master's in statistics with a concentration in data science. ðŸ“Š
I have experience with other statistical software (such as SAS, MATLAB, IBM SPSS, Minitab)  that I couldn't find a badge for yet. ðŸ™‚

If I am not working on a project, you might find me playing Sims 4 or going on a hike! My goal is to visit every national park. ðŸŒ²
